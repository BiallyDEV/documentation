description: How to install and setup Oraxen on Spigot
---

# Getting started

## Install Oraxen in seconds

Installing Oraxen is a fairly straight forward process: drop Oraxen.jar and [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) to your /plugins/ folder and restart your server.

{% hint style="info" %}
Oraxen has been tested with Spigot and PaperSpigot 1.14+
{% endhint %}

Don't want to use ProtocolLib? You can use Oraxen without it but you'll have to disable some mechanics. You'll get the list soon.
