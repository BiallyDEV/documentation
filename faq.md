# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is Oraxen a mod?

No Oraxen is not a mod in the usual sense of the word. It's a minecraft plugin that allows you to add items, blocks and that kind of cool stuff to the game with an automatically installed texture pack.

## Oraxen is using its own texture pack, can I still use mine?

If you are a player: yes Oraxen is using a server resource pack which does not replace anything: you can still use your own. If you are a server owner who is already using a resourcepack: yes but you'll need to integrate your pack in Oraxen \(just drag and drop your files in the /pack folder of Oraxen\) ...or integrate the oraxen pack with yours \(but then you'ld have to do it everytime and that's a little stupid\).

## I would like to suggest a new feature or report an issue
